## Learning Objectives:
This project was designed to test my ability to:
- Use Visual Studio Code as a text editor.
- Differentiate between the three most common JavaScript error types.
- Solve bugs by using error messages.
- Differentiate between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately.
- Create an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings.
- Write strings that embed expressions using template literals.
- Access all the keys and values of an object.
- Write arrow functions.
- Employ helper functions.
- Use find(), filter(), map(), some(), and every() to solve different problems.
- Use reduce() to solve different problems.
- Use sort() to sort arrays in various ways.
- Use the ternary operator, the spread operator, object shorthand, array or object destructuring, and for/in loops.
